# Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

This is the introduction to Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals. This module covers the foundational middleware concepts required to control humanoid robots using ROS 2 and Python-based AI agents.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll learn about:

- The core concepts of ROS 2 as a robotic nervous system
- How to connect Python AI agents to ROS 2 using rclpy
- The structure of humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

Each section builds upon the previous one, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of how ROS 2 functions as the nervous system for robotic systems.
