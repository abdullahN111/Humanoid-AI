# Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo & Unity)

This module covers creating digital twins for humanoid robots using physics-based simulation, sensor modeling, and high-fidelity visualization. You'll learn how to use Gazebo for physics simulation, Unity for visualization, and how to simulate sensors for perception systems.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll learn about:

- Physics simulation using Gazebo for realistic robot behavior
- High-fidelity visualization techniques with Unity
- Sensor simulation for environment perception (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs)
- How to integrate digital twin simulation with the ROS 2 nervous system

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of how digital twins complement the ROS 2-based robotic nervous system for Physical AI and humanoid robotics.
