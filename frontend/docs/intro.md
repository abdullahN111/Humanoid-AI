# Introduction to ROS 2 as a Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to the ROS 2 as a Robotic Nervous System documentation module. This module is designed for software engineers, AI developers, and robotics students transitioning from AI/agents to humanoid robotics.

## Overview

This module covers the foundational middleware concepts required to control humanoid robots using ROS 2 and Python-based AI agents. You'll learn about:

- The core concepts of ROS 2 as a robotic nervous system
- How to connect Python AI agents to ROS 2 using rclpy
- The structure of humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

Each section builds upon the previous one, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of how ROS 2 functions as the nervous system for robotic systems.

## Target Audience

This documentation is specifically tailored for:

- **Software Engineers**: Looking to understand robotics concepts and ROS 2 architecture
- **AI Developers**: Wanting to connect AI/LLM agents to robotic systems
- **Robotics Students**: Transitioning from AI/agents to humanoid robotics

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this module, you should have:

- Basic understanding of software architecture concepts
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Some exposure to robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

Let's begin by exploring the fundamentals of ROS 2 as a robotic nervous system.
