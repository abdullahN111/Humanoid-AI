# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to the AI-Robot Brain module! This section covers training and deploying advanced robotic intelligence using NVIDIA Isaac for photorealistic simulation, accelerated perception, and autonomous navigation.

## Overview

This module explores how to create AI capabilities for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac technologies:

1. **Photorealistic Simulation with Isaac Sim** - Creating realistic training environments for AI models
2. **Accelerated Perception with Isaac ROS** - Leveraging hardware acceleration for real-time perception
3. **Autonomous Navigation with Nav2** - Implementing safe navigation for bipedal humanoid robots

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this module, you should have:

- Understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals from Module 1
- Knowledge of digital twin concepts from Module 2
- Basic understanding of AI and machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with Docusaurus documentation structure

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Set up photorealistic simulation environments using Isaac Sim
- Implement hardware-accelerated perception systems with Isaac ROS
- Configure Nav2 for bipedal humanoid navigation with behavior trees
- Integrate perception and navigation systems for complete autonomous behavior

## Next Steps

Start with Chapter 1 to learn about photorealistic simulation with Isaac Sim, then proceed through the remaining chapters to build a complete AI-robot brain system.
