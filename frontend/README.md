# ROS 2 as a Robotic Nervous System Documentation

This documentation module provides comprehensive coverage of ROS 2 as a robotic nervous system for Physical AI and humanoid robotics.

## Overview

This module covers the foundational middleware concepts required to control humanoid robots using ROS 2 and Python-based AI agents. You'll learn about:

- The core concepts of ROS 2 as a robotic nervous system
- How to connect Python AI agents to ROS 2 using rclpy
- The structure of humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Structure

The documentation is organized into three main chapters:

1. **Module 1, Chapter 1**: Introduction to ROS 2 as a Robotic Nervous System
2. **Module 1, Chapter 2**: Connecting Python AI Agents to ROS 2
3. **Module 1, Chapter 3**: Humanoid Structure with URDF

## Development

To run the documentation site locally:

```bash
npm start
```
