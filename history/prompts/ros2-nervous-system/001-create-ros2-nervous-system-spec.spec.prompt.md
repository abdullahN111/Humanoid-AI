# Prompt History Record: create-ros2-nervous-system-spec

## Prompt Text

```
Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Project: Module 1 documentation for a Physical AI book (Docusaurus)

Target audience:
Software engineers, AI developers, and robotics students transitioning from AI/agents to humanoid robotics

Module focus:
Foundational middleware concepts required to control humanoid robots using ROS 2 and Python-based AI agents

Chapters to build (3):

Introduction to ROS 2 as a Robotic Nervous System

What ROS 2 is and why it is critical for Physical AI

Nodes, topics, services, and message passing

Comparison to traditional software architectures

Connecting Python AI Agents to ROS 2

Using rclpy to build ROS 2 nodes in Python

Bridging AI/LLM agents with ROS controllers

Command flow from decision-making to actuation

Humanoid Structure with URDF

Purpose of URDF in humanoid robotics

Links, joints, and coordinate frames

How URDF enables simulation, control, and future AI reasoning
```

## Response Text

Created comprehensive feature specification for Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2). The specification includes:

- Three prioritized user stories covering ROS 2 concepts, Python AI integration, and URDF
- 10 functional requirements addressing documentation needs
- Key entities for ROS 2 concepts, AI-agent integration, and URDF structure
- 6 measurable success criteria with specific outcomes

Specification is complete, validated with quality checklist, and ready for planning phase.

## Outcome

Successfully generated feature specification document that captures the requirements for creating ROS 2 documentation for a Physical AI book. The specification addresses the needs of software engineers, AI developers, and robotics students transitioning to humanoid robotics.
